Ideal Fit â€” Static site ready for GitHub Pages

Structure:
- index.html
- assets/css/style.css
- assets/js/main.js
- assets/img/*

How to use:
1. Download the ZIP and unzip.
2. Push the folder to your GitHub repository (root). Enable GitHub Pages from the repository settings (branch: main or gh-pages).
3. The "Pagar" button currently links to the redirect: https://idealfitspain-nbuxk6zs.manus.space/
   - This URL is used as requested but the code does not mention Manus elsewhere.
4. Replace images in assets/img with your real images as needed.
